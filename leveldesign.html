                                <a class="image fit"><img src="images/Map Screenshot4.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                                <h2>Here is a recap of some of the level design work I've done on my game Fateful Fragments:</h2>
                                <br><h3>Tools and Technologies Used:</h3>
                                <li>Unity Game Engine</li>
                                <br>
                                <br><h2>First Map</h2>
                                <p>I needed a forest map design that would be a location that wolves could believably exist in. I had prototype npc wolves and a boss already created, so I needed an environment to match their theme and to compliment my action RPG game. So I began to gather references to use as inspiration for my design.</p>
                                <br><h2>Here's What I Gathered:</h2>
                                <h3>blockout inspiration 1</h3>
                                <a class="image fit"><img src="images/blockout idea 1 ver 1.png" alt="" /></a>
                                <a class="image fit"><img src="images/blockout idea 1 ver 2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                                <a class="image fit"><img src="images/blockout idea 1 ver 3.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                                <h3>blockout inspiration 2</h3>
                                <a class="image fit"><img src="images/blockout idea 2 ver 1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                                <a class="image fit"><img src="images/blockout idea 2 ver 2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                                <a class="image fit"><img src="images/blockout idea 3 area leads to cave leads to boss wolf maybe.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                                <p>After taking a few days to decide on which map style I liked best, I decided to go with the 2nd style of map. Specifically my main inspiration was the last picture above this text. I had a clear picture of what I wanted in my head: A linear path with multiple enemies on it, and a split off path that required some light platforming elements and less enemies. Both of these paths eventually meeting at some 'point of interest' where the player will find the boss to fight. With this picture in my head and references in-hand, I got to work.</p>
                                <br><h2>Here's What I Made:</h2>
                                <h3>Blockout 1</h3>
                                <p>Hopefully you can see that idea come to life here, as we have a large blockout of a woodland area, lots of trees, and two branching paths for the player to travel. Points of interest are a waterfall, a center island, and a red 'temple' at the intersection of the two paths which leads to the boss arena.</p>
                                <a class="image fit"><img src="images/blockout test 1.png" alt="" /></a>
                                <p>After some play-testing, the map seemed simple and fun, so I stuck with it and decided to begin my passes, adding in more permanent environmental props to replace the grey blocks.</p>
                                <a class="image fit"><img src="images/blockout test 2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                                <p>Here is the up-close final result after many more passes adding things such as grass, fog, foam lines for the waterfall, falling tree leave particle systems, and much more.</p>
                                <a class="image fit"><img src="images/with post2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                                <a class="image fit"><img src="images/teaserglide.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                                <p>Overall the experience was very fun, as this was my first time really doing my own level design. I think the map looks great, and the performance is currently sitting at ~150fps on the low end at high graphical settings. On top of all that, my skills as a designer have grown and I can't wait to design more levels!</p>
